Description:
This game is a text-based adventure game where the player embarks on a journey to reach a mystical cave guarded by a hungry wolf. 
The game features a forest, river, and cave, where the player must explore, gather items, and solve puzzles. 
In the forest, the player finds a fishing rod, which is then used at the river to catch a fish from a pond. 
This fish is essential to feed the wolf blocking the cave entrance. Along with these locations, there is a cliff representing the loss state where the player can fall and lose the game. 

Why this topic:
We chose this topic because we wanted to create an engaging environment with animals and nature that felt classic yet simple, using problem-solving to progress. 
One of the challenges faced was implementing smooth item interactions, such as catching fish and feeding the wolf, while making sure the game's logic followed properly. 
Another challenge was setting clear win and loss conditions, ensuring that the game ends appropriately when the wolf is fed or when the player reaches a losing state. 
Through coding the game, we built various game elements like locations and items, testing how these components worked together to create an immersive experience.
